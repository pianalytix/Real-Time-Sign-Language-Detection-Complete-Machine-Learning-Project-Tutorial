# Real-Time Sign Language Detection Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the **Real-Time Sign Language Detection** project! This end-to-end machine learning tutorial will guide you through building a model that can detect and recognize sign language gestures in real-time. This project utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning to enable real-time hand gesture detection, making it a valuable tool for accessibility and communication.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will learn how to:
- Collect, preprocess, and augment hand gesture data for model training.
- Build and train a deep learning model for recognizing different sign language gestures.
- Implement real-time video processing to detect and classify hand gestures as they happen.

The project includes:
- **Data Processing Pipelines** to handle image data and augmentations.
- **Model Training** using convolutional neural networks (CNN) for gesture classification.
- **Real-Time Detection** that processes video input to classify gestures on the fly.
